1.Tech stack: Node.js , Express.js, Mongodb
2.Used MVC structure
3.Used csv-parser package to parse csv data
4.Created multiple routes using express.js 
5.Implemented cors(cross origin requests) middleware using node's cors package, 
because both front end was running on a different port and making requests from there to backend.
6.Implemented clustering using pm2 package and improved websites performance.
